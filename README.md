# Module 14 Challenge

## <p style="color:#CC6600">Background / Scenario</p> 

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity](https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

### <p style="color:gray">DASHBOARD FEATURES</p> 

- Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.
- Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
- Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.
- Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
- Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
- Update all the plots when a new sample is selected.
- Deploy your app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages.
